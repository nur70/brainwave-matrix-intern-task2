# Password Strength Checker

## Overview
The Password Strength Checker is a Python tool that assesses the strength of user-entered passwords. It analyzes various factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide detailed feedback on the password's strength.

## Features
- **Length Check**: Ensures the password meets minimum length requirements.
- **Character Variety**: Checks for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Common Password Check**: Identifies if the password is too common or widely used.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Estimates the password's strength based on character diversity.
- **Pattern Checks**: Detects repeated characters and sequential patterns.
- **Feedback Generation**: Provides a summary of the password strength along with recommendations for improvement.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.6 or higher recommended).
2. Clone or download the repository containing the script.

## Usage
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `password_strength_checker.py` file is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py


Logging
All password checks are logged into a file named password_strength.log for tracking purposes.

Future Improvements
Extend the list of common passwords for more robust checks.
Implement user authentication features to track password strength over time.
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
